    expected = """The Greek terms do not have any connotations of evil or malevolence. In fact, εὐδαιμονία eudaimonia, (literally good-spiritedness) means happiness. By the early Roman Empire, cult statues were seen, by pagans and their Christian neighbors alike, as inhabited by the numinous presence of the gods: "Like pagans, Christians still sensed and saw the gods and their power, and as something, they had to assume, lay behind it, by an easy traditional shift of opinion they turned these pagan daimones into malevolent 'demons', the troupe of Satan..... Far into the Byzantine period Christians eyed their cities' old pagan statuary as a seat of the demons' presence. It was no longer beautiful, it was infested."[7] The term had first acquired its negative connotations in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which drew on the mythology of ancient Semitic religions. This was then inherited by the Koine text of the New Testament. The Western medieval and neo-medieval conception of a demon[8] derives seamlessly from the ambient popular culture of Late Antiquity. The Hellenistic "daemon" eventually came to include many Semitic and Near Eastern gods as evaluated by Christianity.[citation needed]

There are differing opinions in Judaism about the existence or non-existence of demons (shedim or se'irim).[28] There are "practically nil" roles assigned to demons in the Hebrew Bible.[30] In Judaism today, beliefs in demons or evil spirits are either midot hasidut (Hebrew for "customs of the pious"), and therefore not halakha,[citation needed] or notions based on a superstition that are non-essential, non-binding parts of Judaism, and therefore not normative Jewish practice.[citation needed] That is to say, Jews are not obligated to believe in the existence of shedim, as posek rabbi David Bar-Hayim points out.[31]

From Chaldea, the term shedu traveled to the Israelites.[citation needed] The writers of the Tanach applied the word as a dialogism to Canaanite deities.[citation needed]
